# x86Tester

This repository holds the [`x86Tester`](https://github.com/ZehMatt) project with modifications to increase throughput.
x86Tester is used to generate a large data set of instruction execution results, including flags influenced, exceptions thrown and results of operations.
The results can be used to verify semantic accuracy of x86 interpreters and emulators and identify defects in chips.

Huge thanks to [@ZehMatt](https://github.com/ZehMatt) and [@LLVMParty](https://github.com/LLVMParty)!
